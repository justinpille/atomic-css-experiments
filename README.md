# atomic-css-experiments
A readme-only project for organizing my aspirations in atomic CSS.

Atomic CSS means writing single-purpose classes and composing them at the point of use. You can read about the benefits of this approach at the links below:

- [Functional Programming, CSS, and your sanity](http://www.jon.gold/2015/07/functional-css/)
- [CSS and Scalability](http://mrmrs.io/writing/2016/03/24/scalable-css/)

I'm creating a series of opinionated design systems, with predifiend classes geared toward the atomic philosophy. Each system will come with a design kit, including things like paper templates. The idea is that designers and developers can agree upon a system, then work somewhat independently using their own tools.

Mainly these are experiments and I don't expect them all to be practical. I do expect to learn a lot.
